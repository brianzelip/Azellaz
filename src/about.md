# About Azellaz

Azellaz produces handmade bags from scratch in Baltimore,
Maryland. We have a strong commitment to quality, sustainable
materials and are guided by the desire to create functional and
beautiful bags that delight as they assist in your everyday
adventures for years to come. "Made from scratch" means that we
start with bare ingredients (like white cotton duck canvas) and
manipulate them into the finished products that you see, all in
our home studio. Most pieces are dyed with natural dyes and
waxed with a homemade beeswax blend before being sewn up.

## Caring for your Bag

Waxed canvas wears a bit like leather, softening over time and developing a patina. If you don't like the look of any light creases that may appear, you can get rid of them by heating the area with a hair dryer or by leaving the bag in a sunny window. (Heating will also temporarily stiffen your bag, so be sure to reshape while it is still warm.)

If your bag becomes too soft or loses its water repellancy, it
may benefit from a re-application of wax. It is generally
recommended to rewax your bag every year or two if you would
like to maintain its structure, but this varies based on
preference. If you'd like to rewax the bag yourself, I recommend
using a bar of Otter Wax, which will produce a finish that is a
bit softer and more oily than my original wax, but performs well
and smells great. Or, if youâ€™d prefer me to rewax with the
original wax formula, please [get in touch](/contact) and I would be happy to do so for a small fee.

Waxed canvas will repel liquids, preventing many stains before they happen. However, if your bag does become soiled, first try brushing the area with a dry, natural bristle brush (I again like the one from Otter Wax). If this isn't enough, you may use some castile soap with a bit of cold water and the same brush to scrub the stain out. After drying, the area may benefit from a re-application of wax.

Treat the leather as you would any other quality leather items,
conditioning every 6 months - 1 year and spot cleaning sparingly
with saddle soap.

## Guarantee

If for any reason you are not satisfied with the longevity of your bag, please [let me know](/contact) and I will do my best to fix the issue or replace it. I have put a lot of thought and care into making a durable bag, so I want to know if anything goes wrong so I that I can address it in future designs!
