  "body": "An everyday bag that fits all of the essentials (phone, wallet, keys) + a few extras (book, sunglasses, knitting, etc). The crossbody strap is adjustable and removable, so the bag can also be used as a clutch.\n\nI dye each piece with indigo and wax each piece by hand with a beeswax blend. The base of the bag is made from English Bridle leather which is luxurious, water resistant, and durable; vegetable tanned in Pennsylvania by a company that was founded in 1867, from North American cattle. Includes all brass hardware, Riri zipper, and internal zippered pocket.\n\n11 inches wide x 10 inches tall x 2.5 inches deep.",
