  "descriptionShort": "Eucalyptus eco-printed felt and leather tote bag.",
  "body": "This is the pocket-loverâ€™s tote! It includes four outside pockets in eucalyptus-printed felt. Fits a laptop or tablet in addition to all of the essentials.\n\nI printed this bag with eucalyptus leaves I grew in my garden -- no other dyes, the leaves alone create these colors! Eucalyptus is lightfast on wool and will not fade over time. The felt is the highest density of industrial wool felt; it may pill slightly during the first week or so of wear, but simply remove pills with a lint remover (or your fingers) and this will soon subside. Includes all brass hardware.\n\nFor cleaning, a lint roller is your best friend. You may spot clean with water and gentle detergent, but do not submerge in water.\n\nApproximate dimensions: 15 inches wide x 13 inches tall x 3 inches deep.",
