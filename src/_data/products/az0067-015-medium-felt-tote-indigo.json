  "descriptionShort": "Indigo-dyed felt and leather tote bag.",
  "body": "This is the pocket-loverâ€™s tote! It includes four outside pockets in indigo-dyed felt. Fits a laptop or tablet in addition to all of the essentials.\n\nI dye each of these by hand with indigo. The felt is the highest density of industrial wool felt; it may pill slightly during the first week or so of wear, but simply remove pills with a lint remover (or your fingers) and this will soon subside. Indigo is a physical bond with wool and may fade slightly over time. Includes all brass hardware.\n\nFor cleaning, a lint roller is your best friend. You may spot clean with water and gentle detergent, but do not submerge in water.\n\nApproximate dimensions: 15 inches wide x 13 inches tall x 3 inches deep.",
