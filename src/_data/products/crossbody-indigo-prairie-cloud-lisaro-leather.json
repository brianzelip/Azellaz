  "body": "An everyday bag that fits all of the essentials (phone, wallet, keys) + a few extras (book, sunglasses, knitting, etc).

The base of the bag is made from lisaro leather, which is hand tanned and luxurious. Includes all brass hardware, Riri zipper, and internal zippered pocket.\n\n11 inches wide x 10 inches tall x 2.5 inches deep.",
