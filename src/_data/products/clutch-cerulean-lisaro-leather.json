  "descriptionShort": "Small beeswaxed canvas and leather clutch.",
  "body": "Great as an evening clutch, a small crossbody bag, a pouch for organizing in a larger bag, or all three! Fits the essentials (phone, credit cards, keys). I particularly love this bag for travel as it fits compactly in a suitcase and can be used for both nights out and minimalist day trips.\n\nEach piece is hand waxed with beeswax. The base of the bag is made from lisaro leather, which is hand tanned and luxurious. Includes all brass hardware and a Riri zipper.\n\n7 inches wide x 4.5 inches tall x 1.5 inches deep.\n\nAvailable with wrist strap, crossbody strap, or both. Make your selection from within the shopping cart.",
